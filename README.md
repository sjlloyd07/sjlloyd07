## Hello, I'm Steve

An enthusiastic learner and problem solver.

Gathering data about everything has always come intuitively to me, and the more I learn about not only modern data analysis and visualization, but data engineering, the more enthusiastic I become about the future possibilities in the world of data.

I'm in the process of transitioning careers from supply chain operations to analytics.
