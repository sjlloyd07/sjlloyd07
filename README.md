## Hello, I'm Steve

An enthusiastic learner and problem solver.  

I spend my free time either being outdoors or reading about what makes things tick.

I'm in the process of transitioning careers from operations management to analytics.  

Recently, I've been enjoying learning methods of data analysis with python and SQL, as well as database design.
